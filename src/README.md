# Webpack Starter

A Webpack boilerplate

## What's required

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (version 4.x.x)
* Optional: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## What's included

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) module bundler.
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with [auto-prefixing](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
* [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) for autoreloading.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) for ES2015 support with module loading.

## Developing with it

* To start the development environment, run `yarn start`, or alternatively `npm start` - to stop this process press `ctrl + c`.
* This will start the dev server and make the project available at `http://localhost:8080/.
* Source files for developing your project are in `src` and the distribution folder for the compiled assets is `dist`. Any changes made to files in the `dist` directory will be overwritten.

### Build scripts

 * `yarn build` or `npm build` to build minified, development assets with vendor prefixes
